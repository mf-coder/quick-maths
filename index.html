        20 different arithmetic problems will be presented to you. Your goal is
        to answer as many as you can correctly. The point of this quiz isn't to
        speedrun the questions, so no timers will be featured. Please feel free
        to take as much time as you need. This game was made to help improve
        mental addition and multiplication.
